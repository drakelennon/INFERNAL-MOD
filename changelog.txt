Infernal Zone is a difficulty overhaul mod for State Of Decay 2 Nightmare Zone, made outta some other mods and much new stuff I did.
In this mod, you'll find many stuff from other mods like Heilo's Bloodfestation, and stuff from TheNeru's DEHD, but they were drasticaly changed here.
I wanted to make this mod because, in my opinion, nightmare zone is too easy and my friends and me were lacking some challenge.
Infernal Zone is designed to be played by 3-4 good players.
