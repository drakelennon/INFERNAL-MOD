Infernal Zone is a difficulty overhaul mod for State Of Decay 2 Nightmare Zone, inspired in some other mods and much new stuff to make the game harder.
I wanted to make this mod because, in my opinion, nightmare zone is too easy and my friends and me were lacking some challenge.
Infernal Zone is designed to be played by 2-4 good players, but you can play it alone if you are good enough.
Some modifications were made to help the player deal with this higher difficulty, like starting with a gun and crouch sprinting enalbled, etc.

Special Thanks to: 
LuSka and Ov√£o for testing this mod.


I decided not to post this mod on SOD2 Modding Discord because I disagree with rule 3.
In my opinion, mods are no intellectual property, they are just edits of a present game file
made BY the community FOR the community, to give credits for using other modder assets is OK
but WE OWN NOTHING.

You can use my assets as you wish, just give me credits and that's it. 
And if you don't, that's ok anyway, I'm always OK when the community wins.
Peace!
