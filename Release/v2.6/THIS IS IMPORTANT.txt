So, apparently I made some enemies in the SOD2 Modding Discord
because I care about SOD2 players community and they only care
about their own egos, they got angry because I used assets they
claim to be theirs to make this mod. Just to be clear I did not
use any asset made by them, what I did was the same thing they did
I edited game files that were already in the original game.
Apparently, in their community, if you change a value from 3 to 5
in a original game asset, it makes it YOUR asset, and if you do the same
you are a thief. Well that's BS, right?
They are reporting my mod on Nexus so it gets banned asap.
Don't worry, they will not stop me.

As long as I have your support, I'll keep updating this mod. 
Thanks everyone for you support, I'm doing this for you.

That's why I'm not gonna ask for donations here.
