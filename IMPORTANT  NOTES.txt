Don't worry guys, with the upcoming Lethal Zone update from Undead Labs, this is what I have to say:

From what I've seen and heard about this new difficulty level in the game, 
my mod will still be more challenging and fun than Lethal Zone because it changes more than
just the difficulty level of the game, Crouch Sprinting, Altered Starting Itens, The different packs of Freaks I created,
Plague Hearts behaviour, Damage Multipliers, Zombie Screaming louder, Bigger Bloater Gas and a bunch of stuff I changed in the game mechanics still makes this mod
better than Lethal Zone in my opinion.

And of course I'm gonna see what things in Lethal Zone are good enough to be brought to Infernal Zone!

TY all for playing!
